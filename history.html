	<h2>History</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>At first, keyboards were custom-built by hobbyists, but with the advent of mass-produced business computers, standardized keyboards were becoming more the norm. Mechanical and membrane dome switches make up the majority of today's keyboard designs. Generally, mechanical switches literally implement wire springs to activate a circuit switch, whereas membrane dome switches use layered synthetic dome signify a character stroke.</p>

	One of the first standardized keyboards created, was the IBM Model M. The IBM Model M is still considered the pinnacle of mechanical switch innovation and one of the best example of industrial design. It was built both to be durable and responsive. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast are still using some of these original Model M keyboards, even after years of usage.</p>
	<p>Why aren't mechanical keyboards more popular? Unfortunately with the advent of flexible membrane circuit designs and laptop computers, keyboards evolved into smaller, lighter, and more portable designs. At the same time, mechanical keyboards were phased out due to their exacting standards, large size and high manufacturing costs. Membrane dome switches currently dominate the commercial keyboard industry.</p>
